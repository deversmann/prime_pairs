# prime_pairs

This is a program written in go to solve the Matt Parker's [Maths Puzzles](http://www.think-maths.co.uk/primepairs) 
[Prime Pairs](http://www.think-maths.co.uk/primepairs) puzzle from September 30, 2020. The puzzle is described as

> Rearrange the numbers from 1-9, such that all adjacent pairs sum to a prime number.

While I came up with my initial solution by building a spreadsheet to check candidate solutions and then randomly 
trying some swaps till a solution worked (only took a few minutes), I decided to try to use the problem as a tool to 
help me learn the [Go](http://golang.org) programming language.  After a few hours, I came up with something workable, though, knowing 
me, I'll probably keep tinkering with it for a few weeks.
